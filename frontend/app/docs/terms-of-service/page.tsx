      <h2>3. Important Legal Disclaimers</h2>
      
      <h3>3.1 Not Legal Advice</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>THIS APP DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>WE ARE NOT A LAW FIRM.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>USE OF THIS SERVICE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CONSULT A QUALIFIED ATTORNEY FOR PERSONALIZED LEGAL ADVICE.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need legal advice, you should seek the services of a skilled professional. 
        <strong>After accepting an offer but before signing any agreement, we highly encourage you to get any agreement reviewed by a real estate attorney on your behalf.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Not Real Estate Advice</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>PairDraft provides general real estate tools and cannot be held liable for specific advice pertaining to a transaction because it does not offer specialized advice.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PairDraft does not act as a real estate agent, nor does it offer any real estate advice.</strong> The purpose of the platform is to help people buy and sell homes by themselves.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 AI Technology Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>PairDraft uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology provided by OpenAI that can make mistakes.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our AI lacks the nuanced understanding of specific laws, context, and client needs that a human lawyer possesses.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our AI provider may not provide accurate or up-to-date information, and its generated content should always be carefully reviewed and verified for accuracy and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated content, it may not always be error-free or completely accurate. 
        The views and opinions expressed in the content are sometimes solely that of the AI model and do not necessarily reflect the views of PairDraft. 
        <strong>Any assistance provided by AI is not a substitute for professional legal advice.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
      
      <h3>4.1 Transaction Accuracy</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Your transaction may have specific needs and it is your duty as the buyer or seller to understand those needs and address them.</strong> 
        The contract&apos;s completeness and soundness is your responsibility. There may be items that are missing from document templates.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Document Review</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Users are responsible for reviewing the generated contracts.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Document templates are provided as starting places and were reviewed by a real estate attorney, but you should do your own research as to what to include in any purchase agreement you will sign. 
        <strong>The generated content from this platform is offered as-is and we do not guarantee its accuracy. You are advised to verify the information obtained through this platform with a real estate attorney.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Disclosure Requirements</h3>
      <p>

      <p>
        Some features of PairDraft require payment. <strong>You will be charged a fee if you decide to download certain documents.</strong> Should you choose to download agreements, you will be charged for the tools used to create the agreement, and NOT the actual content itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        PairDraft does not guarantee the validity or soundness of the terms generated from templates and therefore offers template information for free in the template library.
